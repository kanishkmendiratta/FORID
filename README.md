# FORID
This android application is designed for controlling an AI robot which detects, maps and controls diseases in an infested field of variable size.

This app can send command to the robot to start scanning the field with a single tap. After scanning is complete, the user can also view the map of the field signifying the locations of infected plants.

This application communicates to the robot through wifi hotspot and does NOT require a working internet connection. The demo video can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds5jvB_OP2c&t=2s)
